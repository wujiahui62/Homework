Overview

Since its establishment in 1921, Cleveland Clinic has pursued a mission of unlocking basic science and pursuing clinical research.

Basic research involves experiments and studies that occur in a laboratory setting. Clinical trials, on the other hand, rely on the participation of human volunteers in order to answer questions about treatments for diseases and conditions.

Research conducted at Cleveland Clinic involves a spectrum of efforts, including:

Searches for genes that cause heart disease
Use of stem cells to fix problematic bone damage
Use of special implants to manage neurologic disorders.
Cleveland Clinic researchers focus on an array of conditions, including breast and liver cancer, coronary artery disease, heart failure, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression and eating disorders.
